# Rich-UI-Docs

This is the Documentation for the [Rich UI CSS framework](https://github.com/MeRichard123/Rich-UI),

I used parts of the [UImini Framework](https://uimini.vedees.ru/)

I made this for my custom CSS framework 

This was built with HTML SCSS and Uimini components 

==================

Features
=============

1. Intro Page about the framework
2. A Documentation page 
      - Showing how to download and use
      - Showcasing the components *currently* available 
3. An examples page to submit what users have built with the framework
4. A timeline to show the changes 
5. Mobile Friendly
